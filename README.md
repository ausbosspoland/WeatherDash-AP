# WeatherDash-AP

## Server-Side APIs Challenge: Weather Dashboard
To use the 5 Day Weather Forecast API from https://openweathermap.org/ to retrieve data for cities and build a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and can display weather outlook for multiple cities.

## Built with
 -HTML
 -CSS
 -JavaScript
 -Bootstrap

- I had trouble with the API calls and correctly implementing the API key. Still havent figured out why the latitude and longitude arent returning values so very much a work in progress still and not fully functioning.

## User Story
AS A traveler
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly

## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the wind speed
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
